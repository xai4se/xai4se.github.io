    "# Software Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To prepare a defect dataset, we first \\textit{extract metrics} of software modules (e.g., size, complexity, process metrics) from a version control system (VCS).\n",
    "We focus on the development activity that occurs prior to a release that corresponds to the \\texttt{release} branch of a studied system. \n",
    "With this strictly controlled setting, we ensure that changes that we study correspond to the development and maintenance of official software releases.\n",
    "Since modern issue tracking systems, like JIRA, often provide traceable links between issue reports (i.e., a report described defects or feature requests) and code changes, we can identify the modules that are changed to address a particular issue report.\n",
    "Finally, we \\textit{label defective modules} if they have been affected by a code change that addresses an issue report that is classified as a defect.\n",
    "Similar to prior studies {cite}`zimmermann2007predicting,Ambros,Kamei2013`, we define post-release defects as modules that are changed to address an issue report within the six-month period after the release date.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the characteristics of defect-proneness, prior studies proposed a variety of metrics that are related to software quality.\n",
    "We provide a brief summary of software metrics below.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code metrics** describe the relationship between code properties and software quality.\n",
    "For example, in 1971, Akiyama {cite}`akiyama1971example` is among the first research to show that the size of modules (e.g., lines of code) shares a relationship with defect-proneness. \n",
    "McCabe et al. {cite}`mccabe1976complexity` and Halstead also show that the high complexity of modules (e.g., the number of distinct operators and operands) are likely to be more defective.\n",
    "Chidamber and Kemerer {cite}`chidamber1994metrics` also propose CK metrics suites, a set of six metrics that describe the structure of a class (e.g., the number of methods defined in a class), that may share a relationship with defect-proneness.\n",
    "An independent evaluation by Basili et al. {cite}`basili1996validation` and Gyimothy et al. {cite}`gyimothy2005empirical` confirms that the CK metrics suites can be effectively used as software quality indicators.\n",
    "An in-depth investigation on the size-defect relationship by Syer {cite}`syer2014replicating` shows that defect density has an inverted \"U\" shaped pattern (i.e., defect density increases in smaller files, peaks in the largest small-sized files/smallest medium-sized files, then decreases in medium and larger files).\n",
    "Such code metrics are typically extracted from a code snapshot at a release using various available static analysis tools (e.g., SLOCcount (https://sourceforge.net/projects/sloccount/), Understand tool (https://scitools.com/), the *mccabe* python package\\footnote{\\url{https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mccabe}}, and the *radon* python package (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/radon).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Process metrics** describe the relationship between change activities during software development process and software quality. \n",
    "Prior work has shown that historical software development process can be used to describe the characteristics of defect-proneness.\n",
    "For example, Graves {cite}`Graves2000` find that the software defects may still exist in modules that were recently defective.\n",
    "Nagappan and Ball {cite}`Nagappan2005,nagappan2007using` find that modules that have undergone a lot of change are likely to be more defective.\n",
    "Hassan {cite}`hassan2009predicting` find that modules with a volatile change process, where changes are spread amongst several files are likely defective.\n",
    "Hassan and Holt {cite}`Hassan2005` find that modules that are recently changed are more likely to be defective.\n",
    "Zimmermann and Nagappan {cite}`Zimmermann2009,Zimmermann2008,zimmermann2007predicting` find that program dependency graphs share a relationship with software quality.\n",
    "Zimmermann et al. {cite}`zimmermann2007predicting` find that the number of defects that were reported in the last six months before release for a module shares a relationship with software quality.\n",
    "Such process metrics are typically extracted using code changes that are stored in VCSs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Organization metrics** describe the relationship between organization structure and software quality {cite}`nagappan2008influence`.\n",
    "For example, Graves et al. {cite}`Graves2000` find that modules that are changed by a large number of developers are likely to be more defective.\n",
    "Despite of the organization structure, prior studies have shown that code ownership shares a relationship with software quality.\n",
    "Thus, we focus on the two dimensions for an approximation of code ownership.\n",
    "First, **authoring activity** has been widely used to approximate code ownership.\n",
    "For example, Mockus and Herbslerb {cite}`mockus2002expertise` identify developers who responsible for a module using the number of tasks that a developer has completed.\n",
    "Furthermore, Bird et al. {cite}`Bird2011a` find that modules that are written by many experts are less likely to be defect-prone.\n",
    "Second, **reviewing activity** has been also used to approximate code ownership.\n",
    "For example, Thongtanunam {cite}`thongtanunam2016revisiting` find that reviewing expertise also shares a relationship with defect-proneness (e.g., modules that are reviewed by experts are less likely to be defect-prone). \n",
