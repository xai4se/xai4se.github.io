    "The success of software engineering projects largely depends on complex decision-making (see {numref}`Figure {number} <complex-decision-making>`). For example, which tasks should a developer do first,\n",
    "who should perform this task, is the software of high quality, is a software system reliable and resilient enough to deploy, etc. However,\n",
    "erroneous decision-making for these complex questions is costly in terms of money and reputation.\n",

    "systems, code review, continuous integration, continuous deployment, and Q&A websites. Such tools generate large quantities of unstructured\n",
    "software artefacts at a high frequency (so-called Big Data) in many forms like issue reports, source code, test cases, code reviews,\n",

    "on leveraging AI/ML and data **analytics** techniques to uncover interesting and actionable knowledge from the unprecedented amount of **software data** {cite}`menzies2013software` {cite}`tantithamthavorn2018pitfalls`.\n",
    "Many software organisations (e.g., Microsoft, Facebook, and Google) currently use powerful AI/ML techniques to make data-driven engineering\n",
    "decisions and automate software engineering tasks. For example, software defect prediction, effort estimation, task prioritization, task\n",
