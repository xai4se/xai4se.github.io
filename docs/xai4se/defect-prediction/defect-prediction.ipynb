    "# Defect Prediction\n",
    "Defect prediction models have been proposed to predict the most risky areas of source code that are likely to have post-release defects {cite}`menzies2007data` {cite}`nagappan2010change` {cite}`d2010extensive` {cite}`tantithamthavorn2018optimization` {cite}`tantithamthavorn2016automated` {cite}`wang2016automatically` {cite}`wang2018deep`.\n",
    "A defect prediction model is a classification model that estimates the likelihood that a file will have post-release defects.\n",
    "One of the main purposes is to help practitioners effectively spend their limited SQA resources on the most risky areas of code in a cost-effective manner.\n",

    "To accurately predicting defective areas of code, prior studies conducted a comprehensive evaluation to identify the best technique of the modelling pipelines for defect models.\n",

    "## The granularity levels of defect predictions models\n",
    "\n",
    "The cost-effectiveness of the SQA resource prioritization heavily relies on the granularity levels of defect prediction.\n",
    "Prior studies argued that prioritizing software modules at the finer granularity is more cost-effective {cite}`pascarella2019fine` {cite}`kamei2010revisiting` {cite}`hata2012bug`.\n",
    "For example, Kamei et al. {cite}`kamei2010revisiting` found that the file-level defect prediction is more effective than the package-level defect prediction.\n",
    "Hata et al. {cite}`hata2012bug` found that the method-level defect prediction is more effective than file-level defect prediction.\n",
    "Defect models at various granularity levels have been proposed, e.g., packages {cite}`kamei2010revisiting`, components {cite}`thongtanunam2016revisiting`, modules {cite}`kamei2007effects`, files {cite}`kamei2010revisiting` {cite}`mende2010effort`, methods {cite}`hata2012bug`.\n",
    "However, developers could still waste an SQA effort on manually identifying the most risky lines, since the current prediction granularity is still perceived as coarse-grained {cite}`wan2018perceptions`. \n",
    "Hence, the line-level defect prediction should be beneficial to SQA teams to spend optimal effort on identifying and analyzing defects.\n",
