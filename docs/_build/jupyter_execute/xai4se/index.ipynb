    "While the adoption of software analytics enables software organisations\n",
    "to distill actionable insights and support decision-making, there are\n",
    "still many barriers to the successful adoption of such software\n",
    "analytics in software organizations {cite}`dam2018explainable`.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, most software practitioners do not understand the reason behind\n",
    "the predictions from software analytics systems {cite}`dam2018explainable`.\n",
    "They often ask the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Why is this person best suited for this task?\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Why is this file predicted as defective?\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Why is this task required the highest development effort?\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Why should this task be done first?\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Why is this developer predicted to have low productivity?\n",
    "\n",
    "-   How can we improve the quality of software systems in following\n",
    "    iterations?\n",
    "\n",
    "These concerns about a lack of explanation often leads to a lack of\n",
    "trust and transparency, hindering the adoption of software analytics in\n",
    "practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, software practitioners are often affected by the decision-making\n",
    "from software analytics. Our recent work also found that practitioners\n",
    "are very concerned about their privacy and fairness if defect prediction\n",
    "models were deployed in practice. Practitioners even asked \\\"Would\n",
    "developers be laid-off due to the use of defect prediction models for\n",
    "identifying who are most likely to introduce software\n",
    "defects?\\\" {cite}`jiarpakdee2021perception`. Article 22 of the European\n",
    "Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) states that the use of\n",
    "data in decision-making that affects an individual or group requires an\n",
    "**explanation** for any decision made by an algorithm. Unfortunately,\n",
    "current software analytics still often do not uphold privacy\n",
    "laws {cite}`jiarpakdee2020modelagnostic`. Thus, the risks of unjustified\n",
    "decision-making of software analytics systems can be catastrophic,\n",

    "Most software analytics (i.e., defect prediction) studies  have three main goals: (1) predictions; (2) model explanation; and (3) instance explanation. We found that 82% of our study respondents perceived the explanability goal (generating model explanations and instance explanations) is equally useful as the prediction goal. However, we found that 91% (81/96) of defect prediction studies only focus on the prediction goal, and as few as 4% of defect prediction studies focus on the explainability goal.\n",

    "### Researchers' Focuses\n",
    "\n",
    "We conducted a literature analysis to better understand what researchers\n",
    "are currently focusing on for defect explanation. We collected 96\n",
    "primary defect prediction studies that were published in top-tier\n",
    "Software Engineering venues (i.e., TSE, ICSE, EMSE, FSE, and MSR) during\n",
    "2015-2020 (as of 11 January 2021). We then characterized the key goals\n",
    "of each defect prediction study into three main goals: (1) predictions;\n",
    "(2) model explanation; and (3) instance\n",
    "explanation {cite}`jiarpakdee2021perception` (see {numref}`xai-concept`). We found that 91% (81/96) of the defect\n",
    "prediction studies only focus on making predictions, without considering\n",
    "explaining the predictions. As few as 4% of the defect prediction\n",
    "studies focus on explaining the predictions of defect prediction models. This indicates that the explainability and\n",
    "actionability of software analytics is still very under researched.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practitioners' Needs\n",
    "\n",
    "We conducted a qualitative survey to better understand what\n",
    "practitioners perceive as the usefulness of each goal of defect\n",
    "prediction models. We found that practitioners perceive that the\n",
    "explainability and actionability of software analytics are as **equally\n",
    "useful** as the predictions {cite}`jiarpakdee2021perception`. 82% of our\n",
    "respondents said that the explanability goal (generating model\n",
    "explanations and instance explanations) is as useful as the prediction\n",
    "goal (see {numref}`xai-concept`). Thus, we argue that **explainable and actionable software\n",
    "analytics is urgently and critically needed**. The research and practice\n",
    "communities should thus start answering the key question: *\\\"How can we\n",
    "make software analytics more explainable and actionable?\\\"*.\n"
