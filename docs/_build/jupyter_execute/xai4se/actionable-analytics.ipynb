    "**Background.** In today's increasingly digitalized world, software\n",

    "people, threats to life, death, and disasters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, software quality assurance activities -- software testing\n",
    "and code review -- are widely adopted to discover software defects in\n",
    "software systems. However, ultra-large-scale systems, such as, Google,\n",
    "can have more than two billion lines of code. Thus, exhaustively\n",

    "to actually do -- or what to avoid doing -- in order to improve the\n",
    "quality of the software system. These limitations often lead to a lack\n",
    "of trust in the predictions, hindering the adoption of defect prediction\n",
    "models in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a scenario where a defect prediction model indicates that\n",
    "*file size* is associated with defect-proneness i.e. code in bigger\n",
    "files is likely to be more defective. This insight may help managers\n",
    "develop quality improvement plans that, in the next development\n",
    "iteration, developers should pay attention to the file size to mitigate\n",
    "the risk of having defects. However, such insights do not provide a\n",

    "increasing or decreasing size reduce or increase defects?). Thus, a lack\n",
    "of such actionable guidance remains an extremely challenging problem,\n",
    "often leading to ineffective software quality improvement plans.\n",

    "risky range values of features. The vertical bars indicate the actual\n",
    "values of features for a given file. The green arrows provide directions\n",
    "of how a feature should be changed (i.e., increase or decrease). The\n",

    "\n",
    "Based on these findings, we summarise our key lessons learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Explainable AI is very important in software engineering, but is\n",
    "    still under-researched {cite}`jiarpakdee2021perception`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Explainable AI techniques can be used in software engineering to\n",
    "    provide explanations of the predictions and actionable guidance to\n",
    "    support software engineering tasks {cite}`rajapaksha2021sqaplanner`.\n",
    "    Other initial successful evidence can be found at {cite}`chen2018applications`{cite}`jiarpakdee2020modelagnostic`{cite}`krishna2020prediction`{cite}`peng2020defect`{cite}`wattanakriengkrai2020`.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are several open research questions that remain largely\n",
    "unexplored:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   What is the best form of explanations for software engineering tasks\n",
    "    that are most understandable to software developers?\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Do different stakeholders need different forms of explanations in\n",
    "    software engineering?\n",
    "\n",
    "-   How can we measure the quality and value of explanations in software\n",
    "    engineering?\n",
    "\n",
    "-   How do explanations from explainable AI domains impact software\n",
    "    engineering practices?\n",
    "\n",
    "-   What are the other application areas in software engineering that\n",
    "    need explanations?\n",
    "\n",
    "-   How can we improve the explanations for other complex AI/ML\n",
    "    algorithms (e.g., deep learning, optimization, natural language\n",
    "    processing) to address other software engineering tasks?\n",
    "\n",
    "We developed an interactive tutorial of Explainable AI tools for SE to\n",
    "support future research. This can be found at <http://xai4se.github.io>.\n",
    "We hope this article will motivate future work to address these\n",
    "important questions, which require the SE community to work together\n",
    "with other disciplines and communities (e.g., Explainable AI, Visual\n",
    "Analytics, Natural Language Processing, Human-Centric Software\n",
    "Engineering)."
